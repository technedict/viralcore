Script to approve all pending withdrawals in the viralcore database.

This script will:
1. Find all withdrawals with status='pending'
2. Update them to status='completed' and admin_approval_state='approved'
3. Set appropriate timestamps
4. Log the operations for audit purposes

Usage:
    python scripts/approve_all_pending_withdrawals.py [--dry-run]
    
Options:
    --dry-run: Show what would be updated without making changes
