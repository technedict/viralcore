# Asyncio Runtime Error Fix Summary

## Root Cause (1-3 lines)
The error occurred because `asyncio.create_task(startup_recovery())` was called in `main_viral_core_bot.py:180` without an active event loop. This happens when trying to schedule async tasks in a synchronous context, leading to "no running event loop" runtime errors and unawaited coroutine warnings.

## Reproduction Commands and Tests

### Reproduce Original Error:
```bash
# This would show the original error (before fix):
python /tmp/test_event_loop_error.py
# Output: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'main.<locals>.startup_recovery' was never awaited
```

### Validate Fix:
```bash
# Run the automated test suite:
python test_startup_simple.py
# Expected: "ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! The fix works correctly."

# Manual test with the fixed bot:
python main_viral_core_bot.py
# Expected: No "no running event loop" errors, successful startup recovery
```

### Manual Test Checklist:
See `MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` for complete testing instructions.

## Explanation and Migration Notes

**Why This Fixes The Root Cause:**
The patch replaces `asyncio.create_task()` (which requires an existing event loop) with `asyncio.run()` (which creates its own event loop). This ensures the startup recovery coroutine runs to completion before the bot starts, eliminating both the runtime error and the unawaited coroutine warning.

**Migration Notes for Maintainers:**
- **Backwards Compatible**: No API changes or external interface modifications
- **Timing Change**: Startup recovery now runs synchronously before bot polling starts (previously was async during startup)
- **Error Handling**: Added explicit error handling for startup recovery failures
- **No Side Effects**: Graceful shutdown and cleanup callbacks remain unchanged

## Alternative Solution (One-liner)
For reviewers who prefer minimal changes, an alternative one-liner fix would be:
```python
# Replace line 180:
asyncio.create_task(startup_recovery())
# With:
asyncio.run(startup_recovery())
```

However, the implemented solution with explicit error handling is safer and more maintainable.
