## The Bug

**Symptom**: Users blocked from creating new withdrawals after approval with message:
> "⌛ You already have a pending withdrawal request in progress..."

**Root Cause**: The approval process set `status` to `'completed'` or `'processing'` but did not set `admin_approval_state` to `'approved'`. The pending check in `handlers/custom_order_handlers.py:439` looks for both conditions, and with `admin_approval_state` still at `'pending'`, manual withdrawals were incorrectly flagged as still pending.

---

## The Fix

**Solution**: Added `withdrawal.admin_approval_state = AdminApprovalState.APPROVED` to both approval methods.

### Changed Lines

1. **File**: `utils/withdrawal_service.py:760` (Manual Mode)
   ```python
   withdrawal.status = WithdrawalStatus.COMPLETED
   withdrawal.admin_approval_state = AdminApprovalState.APPROVED  # ← FIX
   ```

2. **File**: `utils/withdrawal_service.py:873` (Automatic Mode)
   ```python
   withdrawal.status = WithdrawalStatus.PROCESSING
   withdrawal.admin_approval_state = AdminApprovalState.APPROVED  # ← FIX
   ```

3. **File**: `utils/withdrawal_service.py:429` (Legacy Method - Already Fixed)
   ```python
   withdrawal.admin_approval_state = AdminApprovalState.APPROVED
   withdrawal.status = WithdrawalStatus.COMPLETED
   ```

## Verification

### Automated Verification
```bash
$ python3 scripts/verify_withdrawal_fix.py
✅ PASS: Manual approval fix
✅ PASS: Automatic approval fix
✅ PASS: approve_manual_withdrawal fix
✅ PASS: Pending check logic
```

### Test Results
- ✅ 5/5 unit tests passing
- ✅ 3/3 end-to-end tests passing
- ✅ All integration tests passing
- ✅ Concurrency tests passing

## How It Works

### Before Fix (BROKEN)
1. User creates withdrawal → `status='pending'`, `admin_approval_state='pending'`
2. Admin approves → `status='completed'`, `admin_approval_state='pending'` ❌
3. User tries new withdrawal → Check finds `admin_approval_state='pending'` → **BLOCKED** ❌

### After Fix (WORKING)
1. User creates withdrawal → `status='pending'`, `admin_approval_state='pending'`
2. Admin approves → `status='completed'`, `admin_approval_state='approved'` ✅
3. User tries new withdrawal → Check finds no pending → **ALLOWED** ✅

### The Pending Check Logic
```python
# handlers/custom_order_handlers.py:439
for wd in user_withdrawals:
    if (wd.status.value in ['pending'] or 
        (wd.payment_mode == PaymentMode.MANUAL and 
         wd.admin_approval_state and 
         wd.admin_approval_state.value == 'pending')):
        # Block new withdrawal
```

After fix, both conditions are FALSE for approved withdrawals:
- `status` is `'completed'` or `'processing'` (not `'pending'`) ✅
- `admin_approval_state` is `'approved'` (not `'pending'`) ✅

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/test_withdrawal_approval_state_fix.py`)
- Test manual mode sets approval state correctly
- Test automatic mode sets approval state correctly
- Test withdrawal removed from pending list
- Test rejection flow unchanged
- Test idempotent approval behavior

### 2. End-to-End Tests (`tests/test_withdrawal_end_to_end.py`)
- **Scenario 1**: User creates withdrawal → Admin approves (manual) → User creates new withdrawal ✅
- **Scenario 2**: User creates withdrawal → Admin approves (auto) → User creates new withdrawal ✅
- **Scenario 3**: Rejection flow still works correctly ✅

### 3. Integration Tests (existing)
- Concurrent approval handling
- Race condition prevention
- Balance operations
- Audit logging

## Deployment

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# 1. Verify fix is in place
python3 scripts/verify_withdrawal_fix.py

# 2. Deploy
git checkout copilot/fix-f37f3db4-6e7d-448f-a2bd-6af34b860e6f
sudo systemctl restart viralcore-bot

# 3. Validate
python3 scripts/validate_withdrawal_fix.py

# 4. Check historical data
python3 scripts/reconcile_withdrawal_states.py --dry-run
# If needed:
python3 scripts/reconcile_withdrawal_states.py --fix
```

### Rollback (if needed)
```bash
git checkout <previous-stable-commit>
sudo systemctl restart viralcore-bot
# No database changes needed - changes are additive only
```

## Monitoring

### Key Queries

**Check for inconsistent states** (should return 0):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM withdrawals
WHERE status = 'completed' AND admin_approval_state != 'approved';
```

**Find all approved withdrawals**:
```sql
SELECT id, user_id, status, admin_approval_state, approved_at
FROM withdrawals
WHERE admin_approval_state = 'approved'
ORDER BY approved_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Watch withdrawal approvals
tail -f /var/log/viralcore/bot.log | grep -i "withdrawal.*approved"

# Check for blocked withdrawals
tail -f /var/log/viralcore/bot.log | grep "already have a pending withdrawal"
```
